The dominant approach in (trans/sub)national governance of ecological crises, most notably climate change, is ecological modernisation. As a framing of collective action, ecological modernisation assumes that the structure of economic growth can be made sustainable by deploying market instruments to drive the sociotechnical transition away from the present fossil-fueled technological base. However, scientists are warning that such a market-driven technology-first approach, ensconced in the UNFCCC since at least the Kyoto Protocol, might not be comprehensive and rapid enough to prevent global warming beyond 2°C above the pre-industrial levels and thus a significant breakdown of ecosystems, rendering vulnerable indigenous, low-income, and working-class communities across the world.

This thesis analyses how organisations that are operating in the “middle ground”, between the policymaking arena and their social constituencies, are seeking to disrupt the hegemony of technology-first policies, while at the same time proposing alternative pathways to transition away from the extractivist and capitalist social metabolism to a plurality of environmentally livable and socially just futures for all.

Taking an iterative theory-building approach, the thesis first conceptualises the strategic agency of these social actors: against the historical trajectory of industrial-capitalist social metabolism; within the power-differentiated social structures of the capitalist state; and through the framing and distributive struggles sited between the climate action arena and the social field. By drawing on a set of complementary theories — ecological Marxism, environmental humanities, science and technology studies, the critical theory of technology, strategic-relational approach, and institutional logics theory — it proposes two analytical frameworks to indicate strategic openings for "middle-ground" organisations to impact sociotechnical and sociometabolic transitions.

In a second step, the thesis provides two case studies contrasting two organisations and two environmentalisms: a degrowth-oriented Institute for Political Ecology, hailing from the periphery of European capitalism; and a green new deal-oriented industrial trade union Unite the Union, hailing from one of the centres of European capitalism. Drawing on interviews, analysis of documents, and joint research with the two organisations, it argues that they engage the governance terrain as epistemic actors and work with different social constituencies to instil distributive justice into climate action. These actors are disrupting the dominant market-driven technology-first approach and are thereby re-politicising and re-democratising the environmental governance. In a final step, the thesis analyses and speculates on the prospects of their counter-proposals in the present political and environmental conjuncture.
